How many times must a man seek in vain, +
For joy, in a world full of pain ? +
How many lies must he hear in his head, +
Before the precious body falls dead ?

How many births does it take for him to see, +
That one is not the body nor the mind ? +
When will he let go, and simply Be, +
The Awareness, free of ego unkind ? +

The answer, my Friend, +
Is shining Here within, +
The answer is shining Here within.
