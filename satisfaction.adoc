^.^|"_I can't get no satisfaction!_" +

- Mick Jagger

^.^|"_All pleasures of the senses or even of the mind are evanescent; but within ourselves is the one true unrelated pleasure, dependent upon nothing. + 
It is perfectly free, it is bliss. The more our bliss is within, the more spiritual we are._" +

- Swami Vivekananda
